    <h1>Lord Of the Rings? A Trilogy or the Best of All Trilogies</h1>
    <art class="content" id="about">
        <p>Some of us have big families and huge holiday gatherings (in the non-COVID times of course)
        Others, we have <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyOfChoice" id="link" >found family</a> and seeing yourself on screen means finding other kinds of movies.</p>
